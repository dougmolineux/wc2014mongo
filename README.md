wc2014mongo
===========
Originally intended to learn how mongoose and mongodb work. Expanded on to test with Express.js. Consists of 3 scripts: 
 - addTeams.js adds 4 teams to the wc db, "teams" collection. Currently, only group D teams get added. 
 - dropWc.js drops the whole wc database. 
 - viewTeams.js finds all the teams inside the teams collection

Use `npm install` inside the root path of the project. Also, if you want to setup the express directory, run `npm install` under /express
